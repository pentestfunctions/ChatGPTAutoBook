In this chapter, we will explore the various scanning and enumeration techniques used in penetration testing. Scanning and enumeration are crucial steps in the penetration testing process as they help identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a network or system.

Network Scanning Techniques

Network scanning is the process of identifying active hosts, open ports, and services running on those ports. There are several tools available for network scanning, including Nmap, Netcat, and Angry IP Scanner.

Nmap is one of the most popular network scanning tools used in penetration testing. It can scan for hosts, open ports, and services running on those ports. Nmap can also perform operating system fingerprinting, which helps identify the operating system running on the target host.

Netcat, also known as the Swiss Army Knife of networking, is a versatile tool that can be used for scanning, port forwarding, and file transfer. It can be used for banner grabbing and can also be used to test for open ports.

Angry IP Scanner is a lightweight network scanner that can scan a range of IP addresses for active hosts. It can also identify open ports and services running on those ports.

Port Scanning and Service Enumeration

Port scanning is the process of identifying open ports on a target host. Port scanning can be done using Nmap, Netcat, and Nessus.

Nmap can perform various types of port scans, including TCP SYN scan, TCP connect scan, and UDP scan. TCP SYN scan is the most commonly used port scan and is used to identify open ports without completing a full TCP connection.

Netcat can also be used for port scanning by connecting to a specific port and checking for a response. If there is a response, the port is open.

Nessus is a vulnerability scanner that can also perform port scanning and service enumeration. It can identify open ports and services running on those ports, and can also identify potential vulnerabilities in those services.

Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying potential vulnerabilities in a network or system. Vulnerability scanning can be done using Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys.

Nessus is a popular vulnerability scanner that can identify potential vulnerabilities in hosts and services. It can also perform compliance checks and identify misconfigurations.

OpenVAS is an open-source vulnerability scanner that can identify potential vulnerabilities in hosts and services. It can also perform compliance checks and identify misconfigurations.

Qualys is a cloud-based vulnerability scanner that can identify potential vulnerabilities in hosts and services. It can also perform compliance checks and identify misconfigurations.

Banner Grabbing

Banner grabbing is the process of retrieving information about a service running on a specific port. Banner grabbing can be done using Netcat and Telnet.

Netcat can be used to connect to a specific port and retrieve the banner information. Telnet can also be used to connect to a specific port and retrieve the banner information.

In conclusion, scanning and enumeration are essential steps in the penetration testing process. By using the tools and techniques discussed in this chapter, a penetration tester can identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a network or system.
