The "traps are gay" meme originated on 4chan, an anonymous online forum, in the early 2010s. It was initially used as a derogatory term to describe transgender individuals, implying that they were deceiving heterosexual men into having sexual relations with them.

However, the meme's meaning evolved to refer to any male who dressed in feminine clothing or exhibited feminine traits. The meme's premise is that if a man is attracted to someone who presents as a woman but is biologically male, then that man is gay.
